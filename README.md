## Overview of the AgriCruiser
**AgriCruiser** is a custom-built wheeled robotic platform featuring a flexible chassis design that can adapt to different crop types and row layouts. The platform is designed for integration with various agricultural subsystems; in this experiment, a precision spraying system was implemented to evaluate its effectiveness in weed management. The robot is operated via joystick input using a RadioMaster controller, which communicates wirelessly with the onboard receiver through the CSRF protocol. In its current iteration, the robot is capable of handling tasks such as navigation and solenoid control.

## Open-source AgriCruiser 
By offering open-source access to the AgriCruiser, we promote innovation through community collaboration and allow other researchers, developers, and farmers to adapt and build on the robot for a variety of use cases. In the MechanicalDesign folder of this repository, we've linked the SolidWorks models, which we shared through GrabCAD Community. Most of the parts we used are off-the-shelf components since we wanted to keep the build as simple as possible. A few parts did need some basic machining, which we handled with tools like a water-jet cutter, bandsaw, or drill press. For parts that do need that level of precision, there are plenty of companies that offer affordable custom fabrication services, including water-jet cutting, laser cutting, and CNC machining. Because all of our parts were already designed in SolidWorks, it was just a matter of exporting files in standard formats like STEP or DXF. In our case, all of the water-jet parts were made by an outside fabrication company, and some were manufactured in-house at UCLA.

### Power System
- **Main Power:** 24 V LiFePOâ‚„ battery pack.  
- **Power Distribution Board:** Splits 24 V supply to RoboClaw, motors, and relay module.  
- **LM317 + DC-DC Converter:** Regulates 24 V down to 5 V to be used for the ESP32 and receiver. 

### Motor Control
- **RoboClaw 2x60A** controls two MP26 MobilePower gearmotors.  
- Encoders are wired back to RoboClaw for closed-loop speed control.  
- RoboClaw communicates with ESP32 over **UART2**.

### Solenoid Control
- Relay module (4-channel) switches 24 V supply to four solenoid valves.  
- Relays are driven by **GPIO 5, 18, 19, 21** on the ESP32.  
- Each solenoid is powered directly from the 24 V battery rail through the relay. 

### Radio Receiver
- **RadioMaster Receiver** provides CRSF protocol data over UART1 (pins 22/23).  
- Channels are parsed by ESP32 firmware and mapped to throttle, steering, and solenoid switches.  

## Software Design
This section explains the software architecture that runs on the ESP32.  
It covers how to set up the development environment, install required libraries,  
and provides an overview of the main software components used in the system.

### Software Setup

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Install Arduino IDE (v2.x or later)**  
   - Download from [Arduino official site](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).  

2. **Install ESP32 Board Support**  
   - Open Arduino IDE.  
   - Go to **File â†’ Preferences â†’ Additional Board Manager URLs**.  
   - Add:  
     ```
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
     ```  
   - Then go to **Tools â†’ Board â†’ Board Manager**, search for **ESP32**, find **esp32** by Epxressif Systems, find version 2.09 and install.  

3. **Install Required Libraries**

### ðŸ§© Software Components

The firmware is structured into key modules that handle communication, motor control, and actuator management:  

- **ESP-NOW Communication (Optional)**  
  - Enables wireless peer-to-peer data transfer between multiple ESP32 boards.  
  - Used for sending motor commands and receiving telemetry.  

- **CRSF Receiver Parsing**  
  - Reads Crossfire (CRSF) packets from the RadioMaster receiver via UART1.  
  - Extracts channel values and parses them (throttle, steering, switches) to control robot functions.  

- **RoboClaw Motor Driver Interface**  
  - Handles bidirectional communication with the RoboClaw motor controller via UART2.  
  - Commands include speed control, encoder feedback, and battery voltage monitoring to all for movement as well as diagnostics.

- **Relay Control (Solenoids)**  
  - Four GPIO pins control a 4-channel relay board based on the data recieved by controller.  
  - Each relay switches 24 V power to a solenoid valve for actuation.  

- **Telemetry Feedback**  
  - Encoders, motor speeds, and battery voltage are read from RoboClaw.  
  - Data is sent back over ESP-NOW for monitoring and debugging.

With this setup, the ESP32 can:  
- Receive control inputs from an RadioMaster transmitter via CRSF.  
- Drive motors with closed-loop feedback through RoboClaw.  
- Trigger solenoids using relays.  
- Send telemetry data back over ESP-NOW.
