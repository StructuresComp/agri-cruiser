AgriCruiser: An Open Source Agriculture Robot for Over-the-Row Navigation

## Overview of the AgriCruiser
**AgriCruiser** is a custom-built wheeled robotic platform featuring a flexible chassis design that can adapt to different crop types and row layouts. The platform is designed for integration with various agricultural subsystems; in this experiment, a precision spraying system was implemented to evaluate its effectiveness in weed management. The robot is operated via joystick input using a RadioMaster controller, which communicates wirelessly with the onboard receiver through the CSRF protocol. In its current iteration, the robot is capable of handling tasks such as navigation and solenoid control.

## Open-source AgriCruiser 
By offering open-source access to the AgriCruiser, we promote innovation through community collaboration, allowing other researchers, developers, and farmers to adapt and build upon the robot for a variety of use cases. In the MechanicalDesign folder of this repository, we've linked the SolidWorks models that we shared through the GrabCAD Community. Most of the parts we used are off-the-shelf components since we wanted to keep the build as simple as possible. A few parts required some basic machining, which we handled using tools such as a water-jet cutter, bandsaw, or drill press. For parts that require that level of precision, there are numerous companies offering affordable custom fabrication services, including water-jet cutting, laser cutting, and CNC machining. Since all our parts were already designed in SolidWorks, it was simply a matter of exporting files in standard formats, such as STEP or DXF. In our case, all the water-jet parts were fabricated by an outside company, and some were manufactured in-house at UCLA. 

## Mechanical Design
### Chassis 
Begin by constructing the chassis using a T-slot framing system, which enables quick assembly and allows for later adjustments without welding. Use bolts and brackets instead of permanent welds so that each joint can be loosened, repositioned within millimeters, and tightened again using a simple hex key. This reconfigurable setup is essential for adapting the chassis to different crop sizes and field requirements.

Build the frame using aluminum extrusions to achieve both strength and lightweight, making it ideal for agricultural applications. Since only standard cutting and assembly tools are needed, the design remains practical and does not depend on specialized equipment. Utilize widely available components, such as angle brackets, gussets, and hinges, to reduce costs and ensure the platform can be built and modified anywhere.

Finally, design the chassis to allow track width adjustment between 1.42 m and 1.57 m (measured at the driven wheel centers). This feature enables the robot to adapt to various crop layouts in the field without requiring complete disassembly, ensuring the system remains versatile and efficient.

### Power System
- **Main Power:** 24 V LiFePOâ‚„ battery pack.  
- **Power Distribution Board:** Splits 24 V supply to RoboClaw, motors, and relay module.  
- **LM317 + DC-DC Converter:** Regulates 24 V down to 5 V to be used for the ESP32 and receiver. 

### Motor Control
- **RoboClaw 2x60A** controls two MP26 MobilePower gearmotors.  
- Encoders are wired back to RoboClaw for closed-loop speed control.  
- RoboClaw communicates with ESP32 over **UART2**.

### Solenoid Control
- Relay module (4-channel) switches 24 V supply to four solenoid valves.  
- Relays are driven by **GPIO 5, 18, 19, 21** on the ESP32.  
- Each solenoid is powered directly from the 24 V battery rail through the relay. 

### Radio Receiver
- **RadioMaster Receiver** provides CRSF protocol data over UART1 (pins 22/23).  
- Channels are parsed by ESP32 firmware and mapped to throttle, steering, and solenoid switches.
