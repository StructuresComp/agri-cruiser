AgriCruiser: An Open Source Agriculture Robot for Over-the-Row Navigation

## Overview of the AgriCruiser
**AgriCruiser** is a custom-built wheeled robotic platform featuring a flexible chassis design that can adapt to different crop types and row layouts. The platform is designed for integration with various agricultural subsystems; in this experiment, a precision spraying system was implemented to evaluate its effectiveness in weed management. The robot is operated via joystick input using a RadioMaster controller, which communicates wirelessly with the onboard receiver through the CSRF protocol. In its current iteration, the robot is capable of handling tasks such as navigation and solenoid control.

## Open-source AgriCruiser 
By offering open-source access to the AgriCruiser, we promote innovation through community collaboration and allow other researchers, developers, and farmers to adapt and build on the robot for a variety of use cases. In the Mechanical Design folder of this repository, we've linked the SolidWorks models, which we shared through GrabCAD Community. Most of the parts we used are off-the-shelf components since we wanted to keep the build as simple as possible. A few parts did need some basic machining, which we handled with tools like a water-jet cutter, bandsaw, or drill press. For parts that do need that level of precision, there are plenty of companies that offer affordable custom fabrication services, including water-jet cutting, laser cutting, and CNC machining. Because all of our parts were already designed in SolidWorks, it was just a matter of exporting files in standard formats like STEP or DXF. In our case, all of the water-jet parts were made by an outside fabrication company, and some were manufactured in-house at UCLA.
